    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <p>Durak is a classic Russian card game with the following rules:</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The main objective of Durak is to avoid being the last player with cards in hand. The player who remains with cards at the end of the game is the "Durak" (fool).</p>
    
    <h3>Number of Players</h3>
    <p>The game is played with 2-6 players using a deck of 36 cards (from 6 to Ace).</p>
    
    <h3>Trump Suit</h3>
    <p>A trump suit is determined at the start of the game by drawing the bottom card of the deck. The trump suit beats all other suits.</p>
    
    <h3>First Turn</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The player with the lowest trump card starts the game.</li>
        <li>In the first attacking turn, the attacker is limited to playing up to 5 cards only.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Attacking and Defending</h3>
    <p>The attacker plays one or more cards of the same rank. The defender must beat the attacking cards with either cards of the same suit and higher rank or any trump cards. If the defender cannot or chooses not to beat all attacking cards, they must take the cards into their hand, and the turn ends.</p>
    
    <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
    <p>If the defender successfully beats the attack, other players (including the attacker) can add more cards of the same rank as any already played cards. The defender must beat these cards as well or take them into their hand.</p>
    
    <h3>Ending a Turn</h3>
    <p>A turn ends when the defender either takes all the cards or successfully beats all attacking cards, and no more cards are added. The next turn begins with the defender becoming the attacker.</p>
    
    <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
    <p>The game continues until one player remains with cards in their hand. This player is the "Durak" and loses the game. There is no winner in Durak; only the loser is determined.</p>
